# CS350
The project goal was to create a thermostat with the TI Launchpad that could read temperature, increase /decrease the set temperature, indicate heat using an LED, and connect to the cloud. While I figured out how to create and implement state machines, I could improve on the task scheduler. I added task scheduler documentation for how the thermostat works along with a detailed report. This project gave me more hands-on experience with the C language and taught me how to implement code into an embedded system. I think these skills will be particularly transferable to other projects. I attempted to format the code uniformly, kept code as simple as possible, and added comments to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
